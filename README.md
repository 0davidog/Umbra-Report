# The Umbra Report

- The Umbra Report is a blog dedicated to strange and unusual stories.
- Users are able to contribute stories with a supporting image while interacting with the posts of others through comments and likes.
- The site offers an opportunity for community around creative writing or perhaps even true stories.

## Live Site

The live app is hosted on ther Heroku platform. More details on how the project was deployed can be found below [here](#deployment).

## Agile Process

This project is to be made using Agile develpment pricipals to plan and complete the work to a minimum viable product. This involves seperating the work in to a project back log of user stories in which an iteration of the project (MVP) must be achieved by project deadline. 

### User Stories

Following Agile development practice this project has been divided into user stories to give a clear understanding of the project needs, goals and features and to split the work in to small achievable sets of tasks.

[User Stories on Github](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/issues)

Here is a list of user stories for this project seperated in to their relative Epics. 
Each story links to its place on Github where you can view:
- User Story
- Acceptance criteria
- MSCW prioritisation label
- Linked iteration
- Linked project board.

### Project Backlog

Due to the small scope of this project, having a project backlog and seperate iterations didn't seem neccessary as their would only be one project to client hand-over. It was instead decided to keep all the user stories in the one project iteration list. A project backlog milestone was created however on github to follow agile practice. You can view it [here](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/milestone/2). 

### Iteration 01 – Due 05/03/2024

[Iteration on Github](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/milestone/1)

As this is an accedemic porfolio project there is only one interation in which this project will be developed and tested. That being the project start date to it's hand-in date by which all its must-have deliverables are to be achieved. 

# UX

## Project Goal

The aim of The Umbra Report is to provide a space for users to share unusual stories, whether real or imagined as well as engage with the stories of others through comments, likes and uploading of related images.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this project are enthusiasts of horror stories, urban legends, 'creepypasta', ghost hunting and crytozoology. The site aims to be suitable for a wide-audience so meterial that is deemed inappropriate, harmful or 'not safe for work' will be filtered about by the site admin.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created to plan the basic layout of the App.

## Information Architecture

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The diagram displayed here shows the relationship between the database models used in the project.
- The Report custom model links to the User through an author field. This is the site user that has created the report (blog post).
- The Report model also relates to the User model through the likes field. This is a many-to-many field as this allows a user to like multiple reports and a report to have multiple likes.
- The User model is Django's built in user authentication model and is linked to buy the other models.
- The Comment model links to the Report model as post (the subject of the comment) and the User model as author.
- The About model links to the User model as author. 

![Umbra_ERD](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/2ad38ae1-32e0-4682-909d-8cdc3914e12c)

### Database Choice

The project uses the PostgreSQL database installed and managed through the ElephantSQL service and the Psycopg2 database adapter for use with Python and Django. 
This is chosen as the project requires a relational database for interactivity between models.

### Data Models

#### Report Model

![model-report](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/d346faa8-c3ea-42f6-b05a-7274168ef7f3)

The custom Report model is the model that acts as the site's blog post.

|DB Key|Data Type|Purpose|Additional Information|
|------|---------|-------|---------------|
|id(Primary Key)|IntegerField|Unique numerical identifier.|Automatically generated.|
|title|CharField|This is the title of each blog post.|Required. Has to be unique. Max character length is 250|
|slug|AutoSlugField|Slug is a string that can only include characters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. This is auto generated by the content of the title field via the Django library Autoslug.|Slug is editable.|
|author|ForeignKey|The is the author of the report linked to and represented by the User model.|On deletetion of linked User model post will also be deleted. Realted name is 'blog_posts'.|
|featured_image|CloudinaryField|This field allows the user to upload an optional image as supporting content for the report and is done so by linking to the hosting service Cloudinary.|By default this field is set to 'placeholder' (as a string).|
|content|TextField|This is the reports main text content.||
|description|CharField|This field is for a description, tagline or excerpt of the main text to be seen as a preview in the blog's index page.|This can be left blank by the user, in which case the site Admin can fill with appropriate information while reviewing. Max character length is 500.|
|status|IntegerField|This field uses a binary system (1 or 0) to represent whether the report is in draft or published status.|Set to 'published' by default.|
|created_on|DateTimeField|This field states the date and time the instance of report was created.|Automatically generated once when instance is created through 'auto_now_add'.|
|updated_on|DateTimeField|This field states the date and time the instance of report was last updated on.|Automatically generated each time the instance is updated via 'auto_now'.|
|approved|BooleanField|This field is a simple checkbox to mark whether the administrator has apporoved the content for publication.|Set to False (unapproved) by default.|
|likes|ManyToManyField|This field collects a list of Users who have given the page a 'like'.|Allowed to be blank by default.|

Report model contains two model functions.
- __str__(self): Returns string of Title and Author as '{self.title} by {self.author}' for admin display purposes.
- likes_number(self): Returns an integer of number of users who have liked the report.

[x] Create - Registered users (see User model) are able to create a new report as author via a form on the site.

- is_superuser is a boolean field that grants a particular user all available privelidges, including staff status. The site creator registers as superuser during production.

### CRUD Diagrams

## Design Choices

### Thematic and visual inspiration

The theme was inspired by the game Control by Remedy Entertainment.

![IMG_0146](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/33505342-6923-4945-bbbc-5f43e15279c6)

The visual design was also inspired by this.

![IMG_0142](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/9fc87002-e9f3-452f-81a7-5026fc683c13)

### Colors

![Umbra_Report_Palette](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/e969c1b4-47f5-49fc-a7a0-d7bc0939ac29)

- #ffffff Main body text is white allowing the text to stand out in contrast to the darker shades of the background colour.
- #800000 Dark red is used to highlight headlines, hyperlinks and important information such as warnings.
- #008080 Cyan is used as both a body background colour when the background image fails and as hover colour for anchor tags. 
- #000000 Black is used as a background shade to contrast the white, red, grey and cyan used throughout.
- #808080 Grey is used as a background to some buttons.

### Typography

- Oswald via [google-fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?query=oswal)
- Courier Prime via [google-fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Courier+Prime)

![PP4_fonts](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/de643af3-015d-46c6-9890-801da9e8ff59)

Oswald and Courier Prime were chosen to provide an appealing contrast between headings in Oswald and main body text in Courier. Courier in particular was chosen as it resembles a typewriter written document and suited the blog's themes of observation and reports.

### Images

A logo for the site, featured on the About page was created. This represents the sites themes of observation and collaboration.

![umbra-logo](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/63f9f201-93e4-4daf-bda8-b0522240f240)

A background image was created for the site's main body. This represents the sites theme of the unkown and the unusual through it's abstract and distorted appearance.

![SpacialCyanBG](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/12d0feca-51eb-4efc-8769-508946dcb991)

A user-image was created. This is a textured edit of a standard blank user image used to represent an annonymous reporter.

![blank_face](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/assets/135815736/b75e0c0f-457d-4ada-97a7-6a8ced3d20a6)
