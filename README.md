## Agile Process

This project is to be made using Agile develpment pricipals to plan and complete the work to a minimum viable product. This involves seperating the work in to a project back log of user stories in which an iteration of the project (MVP) must be achieved by project deadline. 

### User Stories

Following Agile development practice this project has been divided into user stories to give a clear understanding of the project needs, goals and features and to split the work in to small achievable sets of tasks.

[User Stories on Github](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/issues)

Here is a list of user stories for this project seperated in to their relative Epics.

### Project Backlog

Due to the small scope of this project, having a project backlog and seperate iterations didn't seem neccessary as their would only be one project to client hand-over. It was instead decided to keep all the user stories in the one project iteration list. A project backlog milestone was created however on github to follow agile practice. You can view it [here](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/milestone/2). 

### Iteration 01 – Due 05/03/2024

[Iteration on Github](https://github.com/0davidog/Umbra-Report/milestone/1)

As this is an accedemic porfolio project there is only one interation in which this project will be developed and tested. That being the project start date to it's hand-in date by which all its must-have deliverables are to be achieved.
